# Vehicle Health Checklist

Vehicle Health Checklist is a simple, rule-based tool designed to help drivers get a general sense of their car’s condition based on everyday usage, driving feel, and visible warning signs.

This project is intended for awareness and educational purposes only. It does not diagnose mechanical issues and does not replace professional vehicle inspection or maintenance.

## What This Tool Does

This checklist helps users:
- Reflect on how their vehicle is being used
- Identify common early warning indicators
- Understand when a vehicle appears healthy, needs attention, or may carry higher risk

The result is presented as:
- A health score (0–100)
- A general status category:
  - Healthy
  - Needs Attention
  - High Risk

All results are generated using simple, transparent rules rather than external data sources or predictive models.

## How It Works

The checklist is based on three main areas:

### 1. General Usage
- Daily driving intensity
- Time since last service
- Vehicle age range

### 2. Driving Feel
- Changes in vibration
- Brake responsiveness
- Steering stability
- Engine sound changes

### 3. Visual & Basic Checks
- Tire condition
- Warning lights
- Visible leaks
- Exhaust behavior

Each indicator contributes to an overall score. Lower scores suggest higher maintenance or safety attention may be required.

## Important Disclaimer

This tool does not:
- Diagnose vehicle damage
- Predict component failure
- Replace professional inspection

It is designed only to support basic awareness and decision-making.  
If safety-related concerns are present, a qualified mechanic should always be consulted.
